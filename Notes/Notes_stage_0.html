		<h1>Lesson 1: The Basics of the Web and HTML</h1>
		<p><b>Overview</b></p>
		<p>
		Steve Huffman is the cofounder of reddit.
		<br>The class went over how users, computers, servers, http and the internet all work together.
		<br>Went over general inline and block HTML tags to create HTML documents.
		<br>HTTP = Hypertext Transfer Protocol
		<br>HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language
		<br><b>HTML Attributes</b>
		<br>Attributes = provide additoinal informatoin to the browser	
		<br> anchor tags example <a href="https://www.google.com">google</a>
			<div>One last critical take away from the first class is the concept: computers are 
		<span style="color:red">stupid</span>, they
		<em>only</em> do what you tell them to do. Programing is really all about writing the right instructions.
		</p>
		<div><h2>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h2>
			<b>Developer Tools (in the Browser)</b>
			<p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block elemets form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>
			<b>The "treelike structure" of HTML</b><br><br>The "tree-like structure" come from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can drw this relationship lik a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother, and so on...<br>In a browser, this structure shows up as a seris of nested boxes. There are boxes insid of boxes inside of boxes, and so on... </div>
			<br>
		<div><b>The replationship between indented HTML and boxes</b><p>When you reed an html document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. the more indented and element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding "box" is.</p></div>
		<br>
		<div><b>Text Editors (for programming)</b><p>When writing code, programmers usde special text editorys (like Sublime Text for example). These editors make the programmer's life easier. for example, some text editors will automatically generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.</p></div>
